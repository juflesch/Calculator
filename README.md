# The Exercise - Create a Calculator
Here is a small problem for you. You will have to use list, and dictionary to create a tool, which will take input like (* (+ 3 4) 2) and return the answer like 14. The four valid operators are +, -, /*. Every operator will need two operands to work on. Another input (* 2 3) and the output is 6.

# Input format:
When using this solution, your input's syntax will matter.
Be sure to add spaces between number and operands. Also, ensure that each operation is between parentheses.
Example 01: (+ 1 2)
Example 02: (* (* (+ 3 4) (+ 3 4)) (* (+ 1 2) (- 11 5)))
